# C Pointer Arithmetic and Memory Management Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to pointer arithmetic and memory management in C. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.  The bug stems from incorrect pointer manipulation, which might lead to segmentation faults or unexpected results, depending on system architecture and memory allocation.  Understanding the correct way to handle pointers is crucial for writing robust C programs. This example serves as a reminder of the importance of careful pointer usage and managing memory effectively to avoid common errors.
