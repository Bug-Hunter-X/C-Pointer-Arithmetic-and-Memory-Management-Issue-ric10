/*This corrected code addresses the issue by ensuring that the pointer correctly points to allocated memory and that memory operations are within allocated boundaries.  Note that in this simple example, the issue is resolved just by ensuring the pointer points to an initialized variable.  However, more complex scenarios involving dynamic memory allocation (using malloc, calloc, etc.) require careful handling of memory deallocation (using free) to prevent memory leaks.*/
